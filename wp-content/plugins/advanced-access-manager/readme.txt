Graphic interface to manage User Access to your Front-end and Back-end

== Description ==

Advanced Access Manager is very powerful and flexible Access Control tool for
your WordPress website. It supports Single WordPress installation and Multisite
setup.
This is the basic list of features you can perform this AAM:

* Filter Admin Menu
* Filter Dashboard Widgets
* Filter Metaboxes
* Filter Frontend Widgets
* Manage Comments
* Manage Capabilities (Create, Delete)
* Manage User Roles (Create, Edit, Delete)
* Manage Access to your Posts, Pages or even Custom Post Types

And many-many other features.

The AAM support also next languages:

 * English
 * German (by Kolja www.Reggae-Party.de)
 * Spanish (by Etruel www.netmdp.com)
 * Polish (by Gustaw Lasek www.servitium.pl)
 * French (by Moskito7)

== Installation ==

1. Upload `advanced-access-manager` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Find Access Manager under AWM Group Menu

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I do not see User & Role lists. What should I do? =

Please try to deactivate all activated plugins and switch to default theme. There
is some plugin that printout the redundant javascript code to the header and this
breaks the AAM.

= What is "Initiate URL" button, under "Metaboxes & Widgets" Tab? =

Sometimes list of additional metaboxes is conditional on edit post page. Like e.g.
display custom metabox "Photos" only if Post Status is Published. Access Manager
initiates the list of metaboxes for each post in default status ("auto-draft").
That is why you have to manually initialize the URL to the edit post page where
the list of additional metaboxes can be picked by AAM.
